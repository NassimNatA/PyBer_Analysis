# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of the Analysis 
The purpose of this new analysis is to perform exploratory analysis on large data files with multiple forms of data visualizaton using Matplotlib, pandas libraries, and jupyter notebook that shows the correlation between cities and number of writers along with total fares, riders, and drivers by type of cities. This analysis and visualization will help determine trends in access and affortabilty to project for certain neigborhoods. Below is the deliverables of a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type and a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type for this analysis. 

## Results 
### 1. Produce Summary Dataframe
A summary dataframe was produced by the following code: 

- The total rides for each city type

`total_rides_city_type = pyber_data_df.groupby(["type"]).count()["ride_id"]
total_rides_city_type`

- The total drivers for each city type

`total_drivers_city_type = city_data_df.groupby(["type"]).sum()["driver_count"]
total_drivers_city_type`

- The total amount of fares for each city type

`total_fares_city_type = pyber_data_df.groupby(["type"]).sum()["fare"]
total_fares_city_type`

- The average fare per ride for each city type.  

`avg_fare_per_ride_city_type = total_fares_city_type / total_rides_city_type
avg_fare_per_ride_city_type`

- The average fare per driver for each city type. 

`avg_fare_per_driver_city_type = total_fares_city_type / total_drivers_city_type
avg_fare_per_driver_city_type`

- The following summary dataframe was the output from the code above:

- These results show that when comparing the ride-sharing data between the different city types, it is evident that urban cities have the highest total fares in comparison to rural cities and suburban cities. It is also evident that the average fair for ride is hghest for rural cities, in comparison to suburban cities and urban cities. Finally, it is also noticebale that the average fare per driver is highest for rural cities in comparisont to suburban cities and urban cities. This readout is consistent with the amount of total rides and the amount of total drivers in each city type, in which the urban cities have the highest value, followed by suburban cities and rural cities. 

## Multiple line plot that shows the total weekly of the fares for each type of city
Plot demonstrating Total fare by city type vs. Fare vs. Month was generated by the following code: 

- Groupby() to create a new DataFrame showing the sum of the fares for each date where the indices are the city type and date.
`new_df_sum_fares = pyber_data_df.groupby(["type", "date"]).sum()[["fare"]]
new_df_sum_fares`

- Create a pivot table with the 'date' as the index, the columns ='type', and values='fare' to get the total fares for each type of city by the date. 
`new_df_sums_fares_pivot = new_df_sum_fares.pivot(index='date', columns='type', values='fare')
new_df_sums_fares_pivot`

- Create a new DataFrame from the pivot table DataFrame using loc on the given dates, '2019-01-01':'2019-04-29'.
`new_df_sums_fares_pivot=new_df_sums_fares_pivot.loc['2019-01-01':'2019-04-29']
new_df_sums_fares_pivot`

- Create a new DataFrame using the "resample()" function by week 'W' and get the sum of the fares for each week.
`resampled_pivot_df_by_week = new_df_sums_fares_pivot.resample('W').sum()
resampled_pivot_df_by_week`

- The object-oriented interface method, plot the resample DataFrame using the df.plot() function. 

`Import the style from Matplotlib.
from matplotlib import style
Use the graph style fivethirtyeight.
style.use('fivethirtyeight')`

`new_resampled_pyber_df_by_week.plot(figsize=(20,5))
plt.title("Total Fare by City Type")
plt.ylabel('Fare ($USD)')`

- The following line plot was generated from the code above:
